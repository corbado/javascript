# @corbado/react

## Overview

The @corbado/react JavaScript library empowers developers to build seamless passkey-first authentication into their applications. It facilitates user sign-up, login, and session management operations directly from your React app.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- React v16+
- Node.js v14+

Please follow the steps in [Getting started](https://docs.corbado.com/overview/getting-started) to create and configure
a project in the [Corbado developer panel](https://app.corbado.com/signin#register).

### Installation

```sh
npm install @corbado/react
```

## Noticeable concepts

- We allow this package to depend on react-sdk (for the logic) and on web-core (for the UI logic, namely the flow handler)
