# Playground: Connect Next

This playground tests the @corbado/connect-react package.
We use Cognito as an external authentication backend.
Instead of React we use Next.js for this playground because we have to make a few backend to backend requests (retrieving the appendToken and creating the Cognito user).

To start the playground locally, copy create a .env.local from the .env.example file and fill in the required values.
