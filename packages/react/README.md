## Overview

The `@corbado/react` package provides a comprehensive solution for integrating passkey-based authentication in React applications.
It simplifies the process of managing authentication states and user sessions with easy-to-use hooks and UI components.

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- React v18+
- Node.js `>=18.17.0` or later

### Installation

```bash
npm install @corbado/react
```

### Setting up the package

Add `CorbadoProvider` to your main App component to wrap your application:

```tsx
import { CorbadoProvider } from '@corbado/react';

function App() {
  return (
    <CorbadoProvider projectId='pro-XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX'>
      {/* Your routes and other components go here */}
    </CorbadoProvider>
  );
}

export default App;
```

---

## 📌 Usage

### CorbadoAuth component

Adding SignUp/Login screens is simple with `@corbado/react`.
The `CorbadoAuth` component allows your users to signUp and login with their passkeys.
Additionally, it provides fallback options like email one-time passcode for users who don't have a passkey yet.

```tsx
import { CorbadoAuth } from '@corbado/react';

const AuthPage = () => {
  const onLoggedIn = () => {
    // Navigate or perform actions after successful login
  };

  return <CorbadoAuth onLoggedIn={onLoggedIn} />;
};

export default AuthPage;
```

### PasskeyList component

Users that are logged in want to see a list of all their existing passkeys and they want to manage them.
You can make this possible by using the `PasskeyList` component.
It shows all passkeys of the currently logged in user and allows them to add and remove passkeys.

```tsx
import { PasskeyList } from '@corbado/react';

const PasskeysView = () => {
  // Additional logic or styling

  return (
    <div>
      <PasskeyList />
    </div>
  );
};

export default PasskeysView;
```

### Accessing Authentication State

Utilize the `useCorbado` hook to access authentication states like `user` and `shortSession`.
Use `user` to show information about the currently logged in user (e.g. name and email). If the user is not logged in this value is `undefined`.
Use `shortSession` as a token to authenticate against your backend API (if you have one).

```tsx
import { useCorbado } from '@corbado/react-sdk';

const HomePage = () => {
  const { user, shortSession, loading } = useCorbado();

  if (loading) {
    // Render loading state
  }

  if (user) {
    // Render authenticated state
  }
  // Additional implementation
};

export default HomePage;
```

**Remember to check `loading` state of the hook before using authentication states.**

### Logging Out

Implement logout functionality easily with the `logout` method from the `useCorbado` hook:

```tsx
import { useCorbado } from '@corbado/react-sdk';

const LogoutButton = () => {
  const { logout } = useCorbado();

  const handleLogout = () => {
    logout();
    // Redirect or perform additional actions after logout
  };

  // UI logic and styling for logout button
};

export default LogoutButton;
```
